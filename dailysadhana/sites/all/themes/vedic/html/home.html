    <p>
      Dear Spiritual Seekers,
    </p><p>
      This human form of life that we have received is an invaluable blessing from God. It offers us the unimaginably rare opportunity to perfect ourselves and attain the infinite spiritual happiness that we all seek. But in order to realize our eternal spiritual goals, we will need to acquire proper spiritual knowledge and engage in regular spiritual practice. It is for this purpose that Daily Sadhana was envisioned - to allow every seeker to conveniently learn and practice spirituality for his/her continuous benefit. I hope this service will fulfill the sincere objectives with which it has been created, and will help seekers everywhere in their quest for the Absolute Truth and the journey to God-realization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your ever well-wisher,<br>
      Swami Mukundananda

        I am very happy that I made the decision to enroll in Daily Sadhana!  I thought that learning of our scriptures would be a daunting task, but Swamiji has presented this vast and deep knowledge in a way that is both easy and interesting.  I would highly recommend this course to anyone with desire to learn of spirituality and its practical applications in our lives.I look forward to continuing with the course and any others to follow. <br>

        I am so glad I registered for the Vedic Philosophy course. The philosophy is brilliantly explained. The step-by-step logical manner in which Swami Mukundananda goes through each lesson has made these difficult concepts easily comprehensible for me. I love the meditation sessions at the end of each lesson. The modules and lessons have been organized very well and that has made it very easy to navigate through the course material and website. I find the course review slides very helpful as a refresher. Thank you for offering this very valuable resource to us. <br>

  <dl class="faqs">
    <dt>What does Daily Sadhana mean? </dt>
    <dd>“Sadhana” is a Sanskrit term that means spiritual practice and features frequently in Vedic scriptures. The service has been named Daily Sadhana because it enables seekers to practice spirituality on a daily basis, which is essential to
    </dd>
    <dt>What are the benefits of Sadhana?</dt>
    <dd>All day long, we spend time in the worldly environment where the world pulls us in love and hatred, hankering, lamentation, tension, anxiety and stress. We seldom realize that the worldly environment gradually takes a toll on us and impacts our well being. Practicing Sadhana purifies the mind and keeps our mind in good health. Furthermore, by practicing spiritual Sadhana for some time in a day, we reap the benefits of a spiritual consciousness throughout the day.
    </dd>
    <dt>Is Daily Sadhana religious, or meant for practitioners of a specific religion?</dt>
    <dd>No, Daily Sadhana is intended to benefit spiritual seekers and religious practitioners of all backgrounds. The knowledge offered in our courses comes from the timeless and non-sectarian Vedic literature that have helped seekers around the world for millennia.</dd>
    <dt>How do I register for a course?</dt>
    <dd>Create a free account by clicking on “Enroll Now”. Once you are logged into the course dashboard, you will have the options to take two free trial lessons for the available course or directly register for the course. At the time of course registration, you will be directed to the payment page.
    </dd>
    <dt>How long do I have to complete the lessons?</dt>
    <dd>There is no specific time limit to the course. As long as you are subscribed to the course, you can continue to access the lessons.</dd>
    <dt>Is it possible to complete the course in a short period of time (for example within a month)?</dt>
    <dd>Daily Sadhana is designed to allow users engage in Sadhana every day. A new lesson is unlocked each day upon completion of the lesson for the previous day. The goal is to learn and contemplate on the lesson for the day. Hence, not more than one new lesson can be accessed each day (provided the lesson for the previous day has been completed). However, students can always access completed lessons.
