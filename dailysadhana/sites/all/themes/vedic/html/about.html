        Dear Spiritual Seekers,
      </p><p>
        This human form of life that we have received is an invaluable blessing from God. It offers us the unimaginably rare opportunity to perfect ourselves and attain the infinite spiritual happiness that we all seek. But in order to realize our eternal spiritual goals, we will need to acquire proper spiritual knowledge and engage in regular spiritual practice. It is for this purpose that Daily Sadhana was envisioned - to allow every seeker to conveniently learn and practice spirituality for his/her continuous benefit. I hope this service will fulfill the sincere objectives with which it has been created, and will help seekers everywhere in their quest for the Absolute Truth and the journey to God-realization.
